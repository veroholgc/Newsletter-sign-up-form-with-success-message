## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup  
- **CSS custom properties**  
- **Flexbox**   
- **Mobile-first workflow**  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (form validation + success page)  

### What I learned

What I learned

- Flex vs Grid in desktop layout
At first, I tried using Grid to arrange the image and the text, but it caused alignment issues: the text block wouldn’t stay at the top as required by the design.  
Switching to **Flex** with `flex-direction: row` and `align-items: stretch` solved the problem and gave me more natural control in this case.

- Controlling heights with `min-height` and `height`
`min-height: 100vh` worked well on mobile to cover the full screen.  
For tablet and desktop, the design required smaller cards, so I overrode it with `min-height: auto` inside media queries and set a fixed `height`. This prevented unnecessary stretching.

- Responsive spacing with `clamp()`
I learned to use `clamp(min, preferred, max)` for paddings. This lets spacing grow and shrink smoothly with the viewport, avoiding jumps between breakpoints.

.page-wrapp {
  padding-block: clamp(16px, 5vw, 120px);
  padding-inline: clamp(16px, 7vw, 160px);
}

- Responsive spacing with object-fit

The image needed to cover the available area without distortion. The key was:

.card-img      { width: 100%; height: 100%; }
.card-img img  { width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover; }

- Checklist with aligned icons

Multi-line text didn’t align nicely with icons. I fixed it with:

.checklist li {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-start;
  gap: 8px;
}

- JavaScript

I implemented the core interactivity and identified areas to keep improving in how I structure and organize the JS logic for larger projects.


#### Continued development

Stronger form validation patterns and accessibility 

More fluid responsive layouts mixing Flex/Grid

Small UI polish: transitions for error states and page changes
